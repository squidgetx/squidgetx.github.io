KQI is a reinterpretation of the 1982 film *Koyaanisqatsi* directed by Godfrey Reggio and scored by Philip Glass. It is a live video and audio performance - both the visuals and the music is being played and processed live. The audio from the guitar is analyzed to control the varying parameters of the video processing effects using Max/MSP.
