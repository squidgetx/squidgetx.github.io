  a five minute installation projection piece in collaboration with Mark Saba. This piece was a contribution to the [Lux: Ideas Through Light Project](http://lux.yale.edu/), a collection of audiovisual work projected on the side of Beinecke Library. The animation was created with HTML5 canvas and javascript, while the soundtrack was algorithmically generated using image processing in Ruby and rendered with Supercollider.

  Exosomes are nanoparticles that roam freely about the body, too small for us to perceive their motion within our selves. How do their seemingly random interactions shape our lives? 

  In the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time. How do our interactions with each other shape our lives? Are they random?
