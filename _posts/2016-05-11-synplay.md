Would it be cool if everyone's computers were playing the same song at *exactly the same time*?

We designed a network protocol based on a client-server architecture that would allow audio streaming from a single broadcaster to multiple receivers over a UDP connection. The protocol ensures that the clients are constantly recalibrating their clocks to sync up with each other, since the margin of error in terms of latency is relatively critical in audio applications. The protocol also ensures that a packet loss due to standard UDP network failure is a non-issue.

Of course, it's not actually that much louder thanks to destructive interference. The most interesting application of this project I think would be the streaming and synchronization of different parts of a larger sonic whole across multiple network nodes.
