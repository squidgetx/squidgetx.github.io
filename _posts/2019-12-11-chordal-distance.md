_CHORDAL DISTANCE_ is an interactive music composition and installation artwork. It explores the relation between two players by connecting the physical act of pulling to music.

Two wooden handles hang suspended at chest height, connected to each other with an elastic band. As the two participants pull against each other, they negotiate their mutual physical equilibrium. Music then responds to the surges in tension, releases, and twists highlighting the nature of the participants' relationship. The installation functions simultaneously as an interactive experience and performance tool.

We invite participants to explore the subtle musical shifts in tone and harmonic texture throughout the varying positions and tensions afforded by the installation.
