            Working From Home Considered Harmful

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Throughout the COVID pandemic I have felt mostly positive about the shift to remote work/work from home. Who doesn’t love the ability to get laundry or errands done in the middle of a work day? A spontaneous nap, an hour of commute saved? Even when it comes to actually working and not playing hooky there are undeniable benefits. I bought a standing desk, an Aeron chair, a 27” 4K monitor, ergo keyboard, and occasionally found myself deep in the zone cranking out code or research tasks while pumping music through a nice set of studio monitors. Developer heaven, for the most part.</p>

<p>Now the pandemic is mostly over and I’ve been wrestling with the rather novel problem of building my own work and life routines from scratch. This is of course compounded by the fact that PhD programs are notoriously unstructured. I have an office on campus but it’s cramped, the 1080p monitor makes my eyes bleed, and there’s no natural light to speak of. Most of my research can be done anywhere with an internet connection, so why wouldn’t I work from the comfort of my home office the majority of the time?</p>

<p>By chance, this semester’s class schedule forces a lot more time away from home (many same-day early morning and late afternoon classes). I’ve noticed my life feels qualitatively way better. A large amount of existential angst and anxiety has absolutely evaporated. While I wouldn’t be a good social scientist without noting that correlation doesn’t always equal causation, I’m fairly confident in a number of theoretical explanations for why working from home actually sucks. (After all, class schedules are arguably an exogenous shock to work-from-home exposure, no?)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Mental separation between work and relaxation created by different physical space. This one is huge. I’m not sure if I’m wired more aggressively than others, but it feels so easy to waste time watching Youtube videos and surfing reddit in my home office compared to a coffee shop or my department office. Humans are incredibly spatially aware, and maintaining strong associations between activities and spaces has always been really helpful for me whenever I’ve noticed I’m having trouble spending time the way that I want to.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spontaneous interactions. Nothing interesting happens at home - only exactly that which I expect to happen. At the department, I might attend a talk, have a hallway conversation with a professor. I might visit a bookstore on the way home. I might see a gallery opening poster on the walk to the subway. I engage with the world more wholly outside, than inside. This seems trivially obvious, but for a long time I somehow justified paying New York rent to… live inside a small box and (rarely) go outside???</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So yeah I guess if you feel like your life is oddly stagnant and you are frequently wracked with anxiety about whether you are being as productive as you could be, having a hard time justifying relaxation, and feel disconnected from your work… go touch grass?</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Curiously, even if I don’t accomplish much in the way of work I notice that I’m much more relaxed and less ashamed of slacking off/recharge activities at home if I spend the day out. Something about the primitive brain - daytime outside, nighttime inside. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42771901-how-to-do-nothing">“How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy”</a> by Jenny Odell was probably one of the most annoying books I read in 2022.</p>

<p>I wasn’t alone - a quick perusal of some of the more popular Goodreads reviews reveals some choice frustrations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Odell has some interesting points but good lord does it seem like she would be exhausting to talk to at a party</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Woman discovers trees and then shares the experience in a language that the rest of us use to write grant proposals.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collective self-help for middle-class leftist intelligentsia. Has the feeling of taking a leisurely stroll with your loony hippie friend who is at once an overeducated ecosocialist and a crackpot Zen mind-hacker. You have no idea why she loves birdwatching so much (to her it’s a proto-spiritual experience, to you it seems superficially like playing Pokémon Go) nor can you figure out how she affords to live on the Oakland-Piedmont border without a full-time job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s strange, because at the core the message of the book is something I actually resonate with fairly deeply. I feel exhausted by the constant pressure to be doing something else, something that might make me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SzvsMFaek">fitter, happier, more productive</a> and it seems easy to point the finger at “the attention economy” and the constant comparison to more-successful others that social media usage can engender.</p>

<p>For me one of the more frustrating features isn’t so much the obscure writing style or assumed privilege of her audience, but a lack of focus on actually understanding why it’s hard to do nothing now. A vague hand wave toward “capitalism” and “the attention economy” is as far as Odell gets. It’s less a book about how to do nothing but one about the myriad spiritual and moral benefits of doing nothing, and why doing nothing is good from different philosophical perspectives. It’s simultaneously didactic and yet doesn’t teach the reader much that is actually useful.</p>

<p>Maybe the meta point is that if you want it to be useful you’re still in the clutches of trying to “do something” rather than “do nothing,” but it seriously comes off as lecturey at best and holier-than-thou at worst. The enlightened sermonize in the California sun while the damned scurry in the urban sewer.</p>

    <p>When I got out of college I took a job at Facebook as a software engineer and mostly hated it (except for the part where I made way more money than any 23 year old has a right to). Privilege acknowledgements notwithstanding, this is a story that isn’t actually that unusual if you spend enough time on software forums like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21961560">hackernews</a> and reddit. A nontrivial amount of young people in tech (and possibly other industries!) wish they were doing something more creatively or intellectually fulfilling, whether that is social science research, experimental art, screenwriting, ceramics, whathaveyou. At least I was. But I got tempted by the astronomical signing bonus, starting salary, stock options, and the general allure of making a ton of cash as a young person right out of college, and I suspect many of my disenchanted peers fell prey to similar initial motivations.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/53ac754b69bedda3512ad279?width=750&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>The temptation wasn’t material greed per se, but more security. One corner of the internet I discovered quickly was the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/">financial independence subreddit</a>, which is full of people who meticulously save and invest money with the goal of eventually having enough to retire early and do whatever they want. A popular argument is that compound interest in the modern US stock market is so powerful and reliable that it is optimal to save as much as you can early, because that money will be worth twice, four times, eight times as much by the time one reaches retirement age. By the same logic, making more early on is also exponentially useful, and thus a decently large portion of the subreddit holds jobs they don’t love (or actively hate), holding out for one day getting to do what they actually want to do once they’ve saved up enough money for it.</p>

<p>I spent a couple years checking my 401(k) several times per week and projecting out different savings timelines before I said fuck it, quit, and <a href="/2021/06/11/itp.html">went to art school</a>.</p>

<p>Existential suffering aside, I think it’s important to realize that financial capital is not necessarily the most important type of capital you could be accumulating in your early career years. Creative capital is real too, and it also obeys the same laws of compound interest, even if it’s harder to see it. The more you learn and create, the more you can learn and create, and so on. If your actual end goal is to do something interesting with your time (and actually be good at it), it’s far from obvious that the correct path is to not do it so you can make money to do it later.</p>
