RCTs, Causal Inference, and Internal and External Validity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-can-skip-this-section-if-you-know-any-of-the-above-words&quot;&gt;(you can skip this section if you know any of the above words)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RCT (randomized controlled trials) are considered the gold standard in social science for determining causal effects - that is whether some intervention or treatment caused a change or outcome Y. The idea is pretty basic. You randomly split your participants into two groups, give one of them treatment, measure outcomes and argue that the average difference&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; between the groups represents a causal effect, since there’s absolutely no reason to expect that the groups are different from each other in any meaningful way (because they were assigned randomly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech companies have taken this idea and run with it. Facebook is famous for running thousands of experiments on its users simultaneously all the time. Maybe 1% of users are seeing more posts from friends in their news feed compared to everyone else. After two weeks, the team running the experiment will look at some metrics like time spent scrolling News Feed, or number of likes or comments written. If people who see more posts from friends spend more time on Facebook, they’ll roll out the change to everyone. This is roughly how Facebook, and many other companies, “optimize” their product: someone dreams up a change, engineers build it, it gets tested for a bit, and then if the metrics look good it gets shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, in the social sciences many academics would say that a “single experiment is not enough to determine policy,” which is precisely what tech companies use RCTs for (and increasingly NGOs and governments when evaluating policy programs!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). The concerns from academics usually boil down to something called “external vs internal validity.” Internal validity refers to the idea that the effect of the treatment is accurately estimated &lt;em&gt;for the people in your experiment.&lt;/em&gt; Most RCTs have near-perfect internal validity. External validity, on the other hand, refers to the idea that the &lt;em&gt;results of the experiment generalize to a larger population&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of reasons why external validity might be dubious in an RCT. For example, if you only did your experiment on young women, one might be suspicious that the effects generalize to older men. In this post, I want to focus on a specific kind of external validity violation, which I’ll argue is actually a risk for any experiment (ie, is unmitigatable). I still need to comb through the literature to see if there’s a name for this idea already, but for now I’ll call it the “Heiseberg Effect” (of experimental social science)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-the-heisenberg-effect&quot;&gt;2. The Heisenberg Effect&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-risk-for-interpreting-the-results-of-any-experiment-to-inform-policy&quot;&gt;a risk for interpreting the results of any experiment to inform policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heisenberg effect (which roughly says that one cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle at a given time) is popularly confused with the observer effect, which says that the act of measuring [the position or momentum of a particle] will actually mess with the position or momentum of that particle, since there’s no way to measure something without actually interacting with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, it’s impossible to know the effect of rolling out a treatment to a large audience based on a randomized experiment involving a smaller sub-audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call your treatment Z. By construction, everyone in your experiment lives in a world where not-Z is the norm. Your experiment randomly gives Z for half the actors in your experiment. But importantly, you can only measure the effect of “having Z when most people have not-Z.” This is a different effect of “having Z when everyone else also has Z,” which would be the case if you were to “roll out” the policy globally.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medicine, this kind of effect doesn’t really matter. Someone’s reaction to a specific type of surgery doesn’t really change if a bunch of other people suddenly get access to that same type of surgery. But in social science, where we study behavior of people, this kind of effect &lt;em&gt;can matter a lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is because people in the world react to policy changes around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe an experiment shows that increasing the amount of video in News Feed improves time spent on Facebook. Let’s say that it’s because most of the videos posted to Facebook are actually pretty good and interesting videos, and people like good, interesting content. You roll out the change to 100% of users. Media companies and influencers realize that if they post a video, it’s going to get boosted in feed. Suddenly, tons of content is being produced in video form. A lot of it is actually kind of terrible - it would be better as a news article or a photo. User welfare is actually worse than before, and people start using Facebook less because they’re sick of all the crappy video content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to think about it is that by rolling out the change, you change the “game” (in the game theoretic sense) of the environment, and that the natural equilibrium actions of the actors within your environment will also change. When you run a randomized experiment, it’s really hard to structure it such that the “policy environment” equilibirum shifts at the same time, because by definition you’re not actually changing the policy environment for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Careful readers will note that the Heisenberg effect is not really the most commesurate analogy. I am open to suggestions for other names. “Policy Environment Equilibrium Effect” doesn’t really have the same ring to it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Antibiotic performance is a pretty good counter-example from medicine. The experiment tells you that antibiotics are great, when the status quo is not-very-much antibiotics. But if everyone gets antibiotics, then we breed super-bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. This result is completely unpredicted by the randomized experiment. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They wanted to make a big life decision X. But, they were worried that in 40 years, they would look back at what became of their life, disappointed with things, because they could see a story that started with making decision X and continued by making lots of decisions of type X, and finally after making forty years of decisions of type X feeling like they had wasted their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens to me a lot. X is usually low risk (in a traditional sense), secure, maybe externally prestigious, socially legible, but not necessarily aligned with what that friend actually wants to spend their time doing. Committing to long term relationships, staying in dissatisfying but well paying jobs, taking prestigious PhD program offers in departments that don’t actually fit their interests, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a hard situation to find yourself in, because there isn’t a reliable global heuristic&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Follow your whimsy, and you end up like Diogenes: masturbating in a barrel in the public square. Don’t, and wake up one day wondering why you never did anything you actually wanted to do and suffer under the crushing realization that you never will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the slippery-slope worst-case outcome - that you’ll continue to make decision X because you’re making it now - deserves more deconstruction. The claim is two-fold; first, that you make decision X now, and second that &lt;em&gt;you continue to make it forever into the future&lt;/em&gt;. This second component is doing a lot of heavy lifting in creating this worst-case outcome anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s OK to make decision X, just as it is to make decision not-X. The only thing that makes it not OK is making infinity of decision X (or not-X). Don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;For grad students, tech workers, and general overachievers, I would actually say that you’ve probably been so overconditioned to ignore internal will in favor of external sources of validation that almost always the correct play is to take the high risk choice toward actualization.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-11.49.48.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is sort of a good thing, in the sense that Muslims in New York deserve as much as others to participate in the quagmire-hellhole that is online dating. Anything less would smack of inequality of opportunity! But online-dating-culture gripes aside, this feels like it’s part of a growing trend that I’ll ungracefully call “the capitalism-ization of diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, it seems like the market has figured out that it can extract value from relatively untapped markets by targeting minority groups with culturally specific marketing and product. Big banks change their logos for Pride or Black History Month, Marvel movies like Shang-Chi and Black Panther get made, and dating apps expand their market to Muslims and Mormons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of television and mass media all the commentators were worried about mass media causing the &lt;em&gt;homogenization&lt;/em&gt; of society. The idea was that it would be easier for advertisers and corporations to sell to a larger group of more similar consumers. Since advertisers and corporations controlled the media, we would naturally see a shift toward social and cultural homogenization. Given this, the capitalism-ization of diversity seems surprising, since we’re seeing what looks like a celebration and highlighting of social and cultural diversity instead. Mass media culture largely ignored alternative culture; certainly, you would never see a subway ad in the early 2000s (well, for a lot of different reasons) that &lt;em&gt;opened&lt;/em&gt; with “Halal! Inshallah!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But another view is that it’s really all just homogenization under the hood; a way to capture and bend even more people to a dominant meta-culture where one expresses themselves primarily through media and product consumption. I think this inherent hypocrisy/subterfuge is what makes this trend so strangely discomforting. There’s no real celebration of counter-culture&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, merely a perverse reflection of neoliberalist hegemony into different skin tones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, now &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;insert marginalized community here&lt;/code&gt; gets to writhe under the thumb of late stage capitalism and desperately consume to fill the void in their souls just as much as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I am using cultural/racial diversity, counter-culture, and alternative culture to all reference the same thing in this short piece. They technically refer to pretty different things, but I think one of the most important features of diversity and the whole point of “respecting” or learning about other cultures is that they offer meaningfully different &lt;em&gt;ways of life&lt;/em&gt; from each other. The capitalism-ization of diversity threatens to erase those differences and reduce them to surface level traits. &lt;em&gt;DAE muslim??? Halal!!!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you make a turn, the whole map rotates with you to maintain the correct first-person perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/support-forums-api/attachment/thread-14375376-1383617846373138535.png&quot; width=&quot;256px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The default Google Maps perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to see why this might be a good idea. Paper maps are normally oriented north-south, but most of the time when I’m trying to get from point A to point B I don’t care about whether I’m about to turn to the west - I just want to know if I need to go right or left. Paper maps don’t turn automatically, but I used to sometimes physically rotate maps to match the perspective I was seeing, a low-tech way of doing what Google maps navigation does automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marshall Mcluhan might describe this as a “hot” map media experience. The media is “high definition,” a simulation of reality rather than a mere representation. Paper maps are most certainly “cold,” requiring its users to do a fair bit of mental work to translate what they’re seeing on the map to the physical, geospatial reality around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t miss having to page through an atlas to plan a road trip but I do think that there’s something that is lost when first person Google maps style navigation becomes the primary way used to navigate through place. I notice that I can almost never remember basic directions to routes I’ve driven dozens of times, and even if I might know that place A is 5 minutes away from place B and place C is 10 minutes away from place B, I have no idea where place A might be relative to place C. Google maps enables a kind of shitty teleportation, where I don’t have to pay any attention to my surroundings as I navigate them - I merely follow directions and get to where I’m going, thanks to how “hot” the map technology is (in Mcluhan’s sense of the word).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this kind of thing that makes stories of people following Google/Apple maps into a desert to the point of being stranded seem actually believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can force north-south orientation even during navigation by tapping the compass icon (at least at the time of this writing). This one weird trick™ already helps to recover some of the “coolness” of a paper map (pun intended). I notice very quickly if I’ve accidentally routed to the wrong place, since I have a vague sense of whether my destination is north/south/east/west of my current location. I can improvise shortcuts and detours around random construction or school buses. I have a sense of where different things are relative to each other, since I’m forced to constantly evaluate relative positions and directions as I navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question: how many calves need to be born in order to produce 1kg of whey protein powder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: about 0.07! One pregnancy lasts for a year with the cow producing 8 gallons or 30L per day. That’s about 11KL per calf. Meanwhile, it takes 200L of milk to yield 1kg of whey protein, so each pregnancy yields about 15kg of whey protein (and about 25x as much casein).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently dairy cows also only give birth three times generally before being slaughtered for beef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is a little cold and morbid but I genuinely was curious what the environmental and (potential) moral cost of dairy/whey consumption was. In general it’s a lot lower than I expected, although I haven’t done THAT much work to double check the figures. It’s kind of insane that a dairy cow produces 11KL of milk over the course of a year during one pregnancy. That’s just an absurd quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a cow life experience point of view, probably not awesome being milked 24/7 for three years in a row and then slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">You could say I’m ve-curious.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The art and aesthetics of (social) science</title><link href="/2023/01/31/aesthetics-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The art and aesthetics of (social) science" /><published>2023-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/2023/01/31/aesthetics-6</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/01/31/aesthetics-6.html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people are surprised that an artist (me) is in a rigorous social science PhD program. The common perception is that the type of thinking that artists do is aesthetic, emotional, subjective, whereas scientists in academia are more often engaged in objective, scientific, logical types of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually find the two disciplines to share a surprising amount in common. The types of output are obviously very, very different visually and conceptually. But maybe surprisingly, aesthetic plays a huge role in modern social science, and a big part of a PhD program is actually learning to recognize and critique different aesthetic research traditions while also working to produce your own, hopefully aesthetically attractive creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social scientist weaves together ideas about the world with some kind of observations from it, and presents a composite package that attempts to say something meaningful about a social process. Like traditional visual arts, there is very much an objective technical component (fluency with statistics, mastery of brush control), but neither art nor social science are judged purely on technical ability alone. Instead, a set of concerns that can be loosely described using the word “aesthetics” dominates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In political science and economics, &lt;em&gt;causal questions&lt;/em&gt; are all the rage - attempting to understand whether X causes Y (eg, does the type of government you have affect your country’s economy?)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The kicker with causal questions is that they are basically impossible to answer completely, because you can never compare the world with X to the world with not-X for the same person/country/state/etc. X either happened or it didn’t - we’ll never know really how the United States under a dictatorship would have turned out because we live in the timeline where it is a democracy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Not being able to observe the “counterfactual” is known as the ‘fundamental problem of causal inference’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every attempt to answer a causal question is flawed. We get around the issue by making certain, untestable assumptions about the world and our observations - but each of these assumptions is an imperfection in the intellectual house of cards that makes up a research paper. The aesthetic question is whether the flaws are truly ugly, or merely acceptable, or in rare cases even elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Whether causal questions themselves are “beautiful” or important is also an aesthetic concern. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In economics terms, this would be a marginal improvement to the extent that how much “worse” the thing becomes in dollars is less than how much money is saved by it becoming cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a diverse market with all kinds of services and products at different value points, this kind of price-point on its own isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Company A might offer a kinda bad service at dirt cheap prices while company B offers a pretty good service at a pretty expensive price. They might have similar “value” (maybe expressed by something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quality - price&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that if it becomes way easier to make small changes that dramatically move price while only moderately making quality worse. Assume it’s a no-brainer for company B to save 100M dollars and only sacrifice 1M in revenue from lessened customer experience. The market dictates that company B either makes that change, or dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a race to the bottom where everything sucks but approaches free in price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a decent model for a large part of the first world economy today, unfortunately. Software, is AMAZING at making an existing service way cheaper but a tiny bit worse, typically by using automation and conceptual abstraction to build scale at the cost of local detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Sometimes it’s possible to make something that exists (a product, service, etc) worse but significantly cheaper.

Who doesn’t love the ability to get laundry or errands done in the middle of a work day? A spontaneous nap, an hour of commute saved? Even when it comes to actually working and not playing hooky there are undeniable benefits. I bought a standing desk, an Aeron chair, a 27” 4K monitor, ergo keyboard, and occasionally found myself deep in the zone cranking out code or research tasks while pumping music through a nice set of studio monitors. Developer heaven, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the pandemic is mostly over and I’ve been wrestling with the rather novel problem of building my own work and life routines from scratch. This is of course compounded by the fact that PhD programs are notoriously unstructured. I have an office on campus but it’s cramped, the 1080p monitor makes my eyes bleed, and there’s no natural light to speak of. Most of my research can be done anywhere with an internet connection, so why wouldn’t I work from the comfort of my home office the majority of the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By chance, this semester’s class schedule forces a lot more time away from home (many same-day early morning and late afternoon classes). I’ve noticed my life feels qualitatively way better. A large amount of existential angst and anxiety has absolutely evaporated. While I wouldn’t be a good social scientist without noting that correlation doesn’t always equal causation, I’m fairly confident in a number of theoretical explanations for why working from home actually sucks. (After all, class schedules are arguably an exogenous shock to work-from-home exposure, no?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mental separation between work and relaxation created by different physical space. This one is huge. I’m not sure if I’m wired more aggressively than others, but it feels so easy to waste time watching Youtube videos and surfing reddit in my home office compared to a coffee shop or my department office. Humans are incredibly spatially aware, and maintaining strong associations between activities and spaces has always been really helpful for me whenever I’ve noticed I’m having trouble spending time the way that I want to.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spontaneous interactions. Nothing interesting happens at home - only exactly that which I expect to happen. At the department, I might attend a talk, have a hallway conversation with a professor. I might visit a bookstore on the way home. I might see a gallery opening poster on the walk to the subway. I engage with the world more wholly outside, than inside. This seems trivially obvious, but for a long time I somehow justified paying New York rent to… live inside a small box and (rarely) go outside???&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah I guess if you feel like your life is oddly stagnant and you are frequently wracked with anxiety about whether you are being as productive as you could be, having a hard time justifying relaxation, and feel disconnected from your work… go touch grass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Curiously, even if I don’t accomplish much in the way of work I notice that I’m much more relaxed and less ashamed of slacking off/recharge activities at home if I spend the day out. Something about the primitive brain - daytime outside, nighttime inside. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
