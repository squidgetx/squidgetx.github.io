&lt;p&gt;Question: how many calves need to be born in order to produce 1kg of whey protein powder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: about 0.07! One pregnancy lasts for a year with the cow producing 8 gallons or 30L per day. That’s about 11KL per calf. Meanwhile, it takes 200L of milk to yield 1kg of whey protein, so each pregnancy yields about 15kg of whey protein (and about 25x as much casein).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently dairy cows also only give birth three times generally before being slaughtered for beef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exercise is a little cold and morbid but I genuinely was curious what the environmental and (potential) moral cost of dairy/whey consumption was. In general it’s a lot lower than I expected, although I haven’t done THAT much work to double check the figures. It’s kind of insane that a dairy cow produces 11KL of milk over the course of a year during one pregnancy. That’s just an absurd quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a cow life experience point of view, probably not awesome being milked 24/7 for three years in a row and then slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">You could say I’m ve-curious.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hot and Cold Media: Google Maps Edition</title><link href="/2023/01/31/maps-9.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hot and Cold Media: Google Maps Edition" /><published>2023-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/2023/01/31/maps-9</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/01/31/maps-9.html">&lt;p&gt;When you’re using Google Maps navigation, the default perspective is first-person.

&lt;em&gt;The default Google Maps perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to see why this might be a good idea. Paper maps are normally oriented north-south, but most of the time when I’m trying to get from point A to point B I don’t care about whether I’m about to turn to the west - I just want to know if I need to go right or left. Paper maps don’t turn automatically, but I used to sometimes physically rotate maps to match the perspective I was seeing, a low-tech way of doing what Google maps navigation does automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marshall Mcluhan might describe this as a “hot” map media experience. The media is “high definition,” a simulation of reality rather than a mere representation. Paper maps are most certainly “cold,” requiring its users to do a fair bit of mental work to translate what they’re seeing on the map to the physical, geospatial reality around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t miss having to page through an atlas to plan a road trip but I do think that there’s something that is lost when first person Google maps style navigation becomes the primary way used to navigate through place. I notice that I can almost never remember basic directions to routes I’ve driven dozens of times, and even if I might know that place A is 5 minutes away from place B and place C is 10 minutes away from place B, I have no idea where place A might be relative to place C. Google maps enables a kind of shitty teleportation, where I don’t have to pay any attention to my surroundings as I navigate them - I merely follow directions and get to where I’m going, thanks to how “hot” the map technology is (in Mcluhan’s sense of the word).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this kind of thing that makes stories of people following Google/Apple maps into a desert to the point of being stranded seem actually believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can force north-south orientation even during navigation by tapping the compass icon (at least at the time of this writing). This one weird trick™ already helps to recover some of the “coolness” of a paper map (pun intended). I notice very quickly if I’ve accidentally routed to the wrong place, since I have a vague sense of whether my destination is north/south/east/west of my current location. I can improvise shortcuts and detours around random construction or school buses. I have a sense of where different things are relative to each other, since I’m forced to constantly evaluate relative positions and directions as I navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

The common perception is that the type of thinking that artists do is aesthetic, emotional, subjective, whereas scientists in academia are more often engaged in objective, scientific, logical types of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually find the two disciplines to share a surprising amount in common. The types of output are obviously very, very different visually and conceptually. But maybe surprisingly, aesthetic plays a huge role in modern social science, and a big part of a PhD program is actually learning to recognize and critique different aesthetic research traditions while also working to produce your own, hopefully aesthetically attractive creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social scientist weaves together ideas about the world with some kind of observations from it, and presents a composite package that attempts to say something meaningful about a social process. Like traditional visual arts, there is very much an objective technical component (fluency with statistics, mastery of brush control), but neither art nor social science are judged purely on technical ability alone. Instead, a set of concerns that can be loosely described using the word “aesthetics” dominates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In political science and economics, &lt;em&gt;causal questions&lt;/em&gt; are all the rage - attempting to understand whether X causes Y (eg, does the type of government you have affect your country’s economy?)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The kicker with causal questions is that they are basically impossible to answer completely, because you can never compare the world with X to the world with not-X for the same person/country/state/etc. X either happened or it didn’t - we’ll never know really how the United States under a dictatorship would have turned out because we live in the timeline where it is a democracy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Not being able to observe the “counterfactual” is known as the ‘fundamental problem of causal inference’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every attempt to answer a causal question is flawed. We get around the issue by making certain, untestable assumptions about the world and our observations - but each of these assumptions is an imperfection in the intellectual house of cards that makes up a research paper. The aesthetic question is whether the flaws are truly ugly, or merely acceptable, or in rare cases even elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

In economics terms, this would be a marginal improvement to the extent that how much “worse” the thing becomes in dollars is less than how much money is saved by it becoming cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a diverse market with all kinds of services and products at different value points, this kind of price-point on its own isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Company A might offer a kinda bad service at dirt cheap prices while company B offers a pretty good service at a pretty expensive price. They might have similar “value” (maybe expressed by something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;quality - price&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that if it becomes way easier to make small changes that dramatically move price while only moderately making quality worse. Assume it’s a no-brainer for company B to save 100M dollars and only sacrifice 1M in revenue from lessened customer experience. The market dictates that company B either makes that change, or dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a race to the bottom where everything sucks but approaches free in price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a decent model for a large part of the first world economy today, unfortunately.

Who doesn’t love the ability to get laundry or errands done in the middle of a work day? A spontaneous nap, an hour of commute saved? Even when it comes to actually working and not playing hooky there are undeniable benefits. I bought a standing desk, an Aeron chair, a 27” 4K monitor, ergo keyboard, and occasionally found myself deep in the zone cranking out code or research tasks while pumping music through a nice set of studio monitors. Developer heaven, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the pandemic is mostly over and I’ve been wrestling with the rather novel problem of building my own work and life routines from scratch. This is of course compounded by the fact that PhD programs are notoriously unstructured. I have an office on campus but it’s cramped, the 1080p monitor makes my eyes bleed, and there’s no natural light to speak of. Most of my research can be done anywhere with an internet connection, so why wouldn’t I work from the comfort of my home office the majority of the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By chance, this semester’s class schedule forces a lot more time away from home (many same-day early morning and late afternoon classes). I’ve noticed my life feels qualitatively way better. A large amount of existential angst and anxiety has absolutely evaporated. While I wouldn’t be a good social scientist without noting that correlation doesn’t always equal causation, I’m fairly confident in a number of theoretical explanations for why working from home actually sucks. (After all, class schedules are arguably an exogenous shock to work-from-home exposure, no?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mental separation between work and relaxation created by different physical space. This one is huge. I’m not sure if I’m wired more aggressively than others, but it feels so easy to waste time watching Youtube videos and surfing reddit in my home office compared to a coffee shop or my department office. Humans are incredibly spatially aware, and maintaining strong associations between activities and spaces has always been really helpful for me whenever I’ve noticed I’m having trouble spending time the way that I want to.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spontaneous interactions. Nothing interesting happens at home - only exactly that which I expect to happen. At the department, I might attend a talk, have a hallway conversation with a professor. I might visit a bookstore on the way home. I might see a gallery opening poster on the walk to the subway. I engage with the world more wholly outside, than inside. This seems trivially obvious, but for a long time I somehow justified paying New York rent to… live inside a small box and (rarely) go outside???&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah I guess if you feel like your life is oddly stagnant and you are frequently wracked with anxiety about whether you are being as productive as you could be, having a hard time justifying relaxation, and feel disconnected from your work… go touch grass?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Curiously, even if I don’t accomplish much in the way of work I notice that I’m much more relaxed and less ashamed of slacking off/recharge activities at home if I spend the day out.

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t alone - a quick perusal of some of the more popular Goodreads reviews reveals some choice frustrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Odell has some interesting points but good lord does it seem like she would be exhausting to talk to at a party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Woman discovers trees and then shares the experience in a language that the rest of us use to write grant proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Collective self-help for middle-class leftist intelligentsia. Has the feeling of taking a leisurely stroll with your loony hippie friend who is at once an overeducated ecosocialist and a crackpot Zen mind-hacker. You have no idea why she loves birdwatching so much (to her it’s a proto-spiritual experience, to you it seems superficially like playing Pokémon Go) nor can you figure out how she affords to live on the Oakland-Piedmont border without a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s strange, because at the core the message of the book is something I actually resonate with fairly deeply. I feel exhausted by the constant pressure to be doing something else, something that might make me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SzvsMFaek&quot;&gt;fitter, happier, more productive&lt;/a&gt; and it seems easy to point the finger at “the attention economy” and the constant comparison to more-successful others that social media usage can engender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me one of the more frustrating features isn’t so much the obscure writing style or assumed privilege of her audience, but a lack of focus on actually understanding why it’s hard to do nothing now. A vague hand wave toward “capitalism” and “the attention economy” is as far as Odell gets. It’s less a book about how to do nothing but one about the myriad spiritual and moral benefits of doing nothing, and why doing nothing is good from different philosophical perspectives. It’s simultaneously didactic and yet doesn’t teach the reader much that is actually useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the meta point is that if you want it to be useful you’re still in the clutches of trying to “do something” rather than “do nothing,” but it seriously comes off as lecturey at best and holier-than-thou at worst. The enlightened sermonize in the California sun while the damned scurry in the urban sewer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">“How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy” by Jenny Odell was probably one of the most annoying books I read in 2022.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creative Capital and Compound Interest</title><link href="/2023/01/24/compound-interest-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creative Capital and Compound Interest" /><published>2023-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/2023/01/24/compound-interest-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/01/24/compound-interest-2.html">&lt;p&gt;When I got out of college I took a job at Facebook as a software engineer and mostly hated it (except for the part where I made way more money than any 23 year old has a right to).

But I got tempted by the astronomical signing bonus, starting salary, stock options, and the general allure of making a ton of cash as a young person right out of college, and I suspect many of my disenchanted peers fell prey to similar initial motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.insider.com/53ac754b69bedda3512ad279?width=750&amp;amp;format=jpeg&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptation wasn’t material greed per se, but more security. One corner of the internet I discovered quickly was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/&quot;&gt;financial independence subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, which is full of people who meticulously save and invest money with the goal of eventually having enough to retire early and do whatever they want. A popular argument is that compound interest in the modern US stock market is so powerful and reliable that it is optimal to save as much as you can early, because that money will be worth twice, four times, eight times as much by the time one reaches retirement age. By the same logic, making more early on is also exponentially useful, and thus a decently large portion of the subreddit holds jobs they don’t love (or actively hate), holding out for one day getting to do what they actually want to do once they’ve saved up enough money for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple years checking my 401(k) several times per week and projecting out different savings timelines before I said fuck it, quit, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/06/11/itp.html&quot;&gt;went to art school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existential suffering aside, I think it’s important to realize that financial capital is not necessarily the most important type of capital you could be accumulating in your early career years. Creative capital is real too, and it also obeys the same laws of compound interest, even if it’s harder to see it. The more you learn and create, the more you can learn and create, and so on. If your actual end goal is to do something interesting with your time (and actually be good at it), it’s far from obvious that the correct path is to not do it so you can make money to do it later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">When I got out of college I took a job at Facebook as a software engineer and mostly hated it (except for the part where I made way more money than any 23 year old has a right to).

&lt;p&gt;So when is web 2.1 due out? I’d argue we’ve already arrived. Ignore the crypto fanatics who are trying to claim “Web 3.0” for the decentralized web, and consider how Internet usage has changed since the 2000s. Craigslist, Facebook and MySpace, the leading lights of Web 2.0 feel like prehistoric dinosaurs. Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok dominate. Is it easy to post to these platforms? Technically speaking, yes. Anyone can post. You don’t need to know arcane computer programming skills in order to push content to the internet. But I think we’re missing something by just focusing on the technical details. People who push content to these platforms invest insane amounts of capital into producing content - and unlike early Web 2.0 projects, content on IG, Twitter, and TikTok is public by default. One competes with a global population of content creators who are probably better than you at it because it’s literally their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barrier to entry on early Facebook was low because you were competing with your friends. Most of the time, your friends were interested in what you had to say because you know, they were your friends. The barrier to entry on Twitter is high, because you are competing with Elon Musks’ latest controversy and the dozens-to-hundreds battle worn Twitter influencers who have already crafted a better incisive joke than you. Most people don’t actually care what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, what happens is that the pre-existing power law distribution of social networks is exacerbated. A select few people end up being specialized, professional content creators. A slightly larger population tries, mostly in vain, to break into internet stardom. The vast majority lurk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this influencer-centric model web 2.1. It’s Web 2.0 under the ruthless influence of the market. It’s sometimes good (influencers and content creators are usually more entertaining and interesting than my friends). It’s sometimes bad (influencers and content creators are usually more entertaining and interesting than my friends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is an effort to combat the negative side. While there’s always some kind of pressure posting publicly to the internet I can at least pretend that it’s not being automatically entered into a cutthroat global attention competition. I don’t need my writing to compete in the global content marketplace, hell, there are probably six different authors on Substack that have already written more eloquently than I have or ever will on internet content economics. Fuck it though, I’ll post because I want to write and I need someplace to organize my thoughts and an easy way to share with my friends, who I hope, will be at least politely interested.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Back in the 2000s “Web 2.0” was all the rage.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News is how citizens make sense of the world outside of immediate, local, sensory experience. As the world becomes more interconnected, the prominence of local issues fades and large scale and systemic issues dominate. Journalism’s role of informing the public and serving as the “fourth estate” of robust democratic decision making becomes increasingly important. However, journalism is far from a perfect, even handed information source - it must inevitably choose, curate, and disseminate only those stories it deems newsworthy. Inherent in the New York Times’ slogan that it contains “all the news that’s fit to print” is the admission that “the map is not the territory.” But what is the map? This project is an interpretation of what it would mean to create an all-encompassing map of news, both to give a perspective on what topics were ultimately covered most as well as what stories were ultimately left untold. Over 1 million US headlines published over the course of 2020 were collected, clustered by topic, and transformed into a terrain map of the information landscape. Heavy news coverage brings mountains into prominence, connected stories are bridged by land, while small narratives and threads lapse into chains of islands. The map reflects the landscape throughout time, shifting the positions of continents and sizes of mountains, allowing the viewer to follow stories as they morph throughout the news lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;technical-summary&quot;&gt;Technical Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mediacloud.org&quot;&gt;MediaCloud&lt;/a&gt; indexes mainstream US media content. The first version of this project uses a 77,100 headline selection from the month of February, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clustering&quot;&gt;Clustering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to cluster the headlines together to extract the topics. There are a number of unsupervised topic modeling approaches which generally use a strategy of trying to find sets of words that often occur within the same document. LDA, is probably the most well-known example. However, I chose to use a newer method, GSDMM, which is specifically designed for short texts (like tweets, or news headlines), although at it’s core it uses a similar technique of looking for common word-occurences. I didn’t do any rigorous evaluation, but a cursory, subjective comparison of the two models seemed to suggest that GSDMM’s cluster outputs made more sense to me and better represented different “news topics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/topics.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above slide shows some examples of headlines for a few GSDMM topic clusters from the dataset. Since the model is unsupervised, the algorithm isn’t able to label any of the topics automatically - it’s up to a human observer to identify a meaningful label for each topic. In these cases, it’s fairly straightforward: the left-most topic cluster contains headlines that all have to do with the Democratic primary elections, the center cluster contains headlines that contain lottery winning number announcements, and the right-most cluster contains news regarding various cruise ships impacted by COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set of examples highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the text-clustering algorithm. Since it’s based purely on words (and does not draw on any latent semantic information, eg on word2vec embeddings or similar), all “COVID-19 cruise ship” news is grouped together, despite there being distinct news coverage of different cruise ships. Some non-cruise ship COVID-19 news also is able to sneak into the COVID-19 cruise ship news cluster, presumably because most stories about cruise ships contain words like “death”, “cases”, “quarantine”, etc. While the clustering technique isn’t perfect, it’s a decent place to start to extract meaningful groups of news headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layout&quot;&gt;Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third step is to lay out the topics in a two dimensional space. I want related topics to be close together, and unrelated topics to be further apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing project &lt;a href=&quot;https://bl.ocks.org/AlessandraSozzi/raw/ce1ace56e4aed6f2d614ae2243aab5a5/&quot;&gt;LDAVis&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for researchers to quickly interpret the results of topic models, lays out topics in a two dimensional space, grouping similar topics close together. However, I want my news map to be usable for folks without an understanding of token salience, lambda parameters, and so forth. In addition, LDAVis’s layout algorithm (multidimensional scaling) is relatively naive, is computationally expensive with a large number of topics, and doesn’t always place topics that I judge as similar near each other, or places unrelated topics close together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/ldavis.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can utilize the similarity measure of LDAVis - the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The missing component is how to lay out the topics while attempting to preserve distances (inversely) proportional to their similarity scores. For example, consider a topic cluster containing headlines on the Harvey Weinstein trial has a relatively high similarity score to a topic cluster on the 2020 Oscar award ceremony, which has a high similarity score to a third topic cluster about new movie releases on Netflix. Ideally, Weinstein’s cluster would be placed closely to the Oscar awards cluster, since his trial and sexual harassment investigations were often discussed in conjunction with his outsized role in the Oscars. However, his trial has less to do with new movies on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled on a force-directed layout scheme, where an attractive force is assigned to topic clusters similar to each other, and a repulsive force is assigned to topic clusters further away. Force layout schemes are common in network visualizations, where many nodes and many edges need to be laid out in 2D space. In my case, topic clusters were the nodes, and each cluster had a (weighted) edge between it representing the similarity score between the two clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/force1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a nontrivial amount of tweaking and pruning of the cluster network was required to get a usable layout. First, I deleted low-similarity edges from the graph. I care less that the distance between unrelated clusters is exactly proportional to their degree of non-similarity: it’s more important that they are simply not near each other. Second, I used min-cut graph techniques to isolate highly connected clusters from each other, and then used a second iteration of force layout to position these clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to think of these second-order clusters as continents, with the topic clusters inside of them as regions or countries. For example, several highly connected topics formed a “continent” of political news. Several other highly connected topics formed a “continent” of coronavirus news. These two continents are also similar, given the politicization of the virus even in February of 2020, and so the continents are placed near each other in the second-level force layout. Meanwhile, a third “continent” of sports news can be placed further away from both the politics and coronavirus content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terraforming&quot;&gt;Terraforming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth step is converting the network layout to geography. So far, each cluster has been modeled as a circle, but perfectly circular countries aren’t so visually engaging. I used a classic map-generation technique: I placed points (shown in blue) randomly over the 2D space, then generated the Voronoi polygon set over those points (borders shown in yellow). Polygons whose origin point lay within a topic cluster’s original circle become land, while the remaining polygons become water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/voronoi.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/voronoi2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;label-generation&quot;&gt;Label Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to generate names for each region. Each GSDMM topic comes with a set of words most commonly found for each topic cluster. I use a simple &lt;a href=&quot;tracery.io&quot;&gt;tracery&lt;/a&gt; grammar to combine the prominent words for each cluster with map words such as “peninsula,” “cape,” “mountains,” etc. based on the number of adjacent regions (eg, “island” would only be assigned to regions with no neighbors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-final-map&quot;&gt;The Final Map&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/news_map&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/bigmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final map is composed of 160 different regions and is fully zoomable, clickable, and explorable. You can explore it yourself &lt;a href=&quot;/news_map&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, exploring the map reveals both latent connections and under-surfaced news stories. For example, while it may be expected that coronavirus news and political news are related to each other, the map also shows that discussion of the economy, the price of gold and stocks, is highly connected to discussions of coronavirus in the mainstream media, perhaps more so than discussion of its human impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/bigcontinent.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the fact that even small topics are visible as small islands, as opposed to being buried underneath the flood of news, allows them to be explored and surfaced in a new way. The map showed, for example, a set of stories on the state of California’s official apology for Japanese internment; something meaningful that didn’t get picked up so much in the news cycle but still very much worth surfacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/internment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a ton of stuff from working on this project, from the history of journalism to unsupervised NLP techniques to network force-layout strategies. There are a ton of improvements I hope to make: automatic label generation (this seems quite difficult honestly), automated deploys of current data (the existing prototype is frozen to February 2020) to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
