Who doesn’t love the ability to get laundry or errands done in the middle of a work day? A spontaneous nap, an hour of commute saved? Even when it comes to actually working and not playing hooky there are undeniable benefits. I bought a standing desk, an Aeron chair, a 27” 4K monitor, ergo keyboard, and occasionally found myself deep in the zone cranking out code or research tasks while pumping music through a nice set of studio monitors. Developer heaven, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the pandemic is mostly over and I’ve been wrestling with the rather novel problem of building my own work and life routines from scratch. This is of course compounded by the fact that PhD programs are notoriously unstructured. I have an office on campus but it’s cramped, the 1080p monitor makes my eyes bleed, and there’s no natural light to speak of. Most of my research can be done anywhere with an internet connection, so why wouldn’t I work from the comfort of my home office the majority of the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By chance, this semester’s class schedule forces a lot more time away from home (many same-day early morning and late afternoon classes). I’ve noticed my life feels qualitatively way better. A large amount of existential angst and anxiety has absolutely evaporated. While I wouldn’t be a good social scientist without noting that correlation doesn’t always equal causation, I’m fairly confident in a number of theoretical explanations for why working from home actually sucks. (After all, class schedules are arguably an exogenous shock to work-from-home exposure, no?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mental separation between work and relaxation created by different physical space. This one is huge. I’m not sure if I’m wired more aggressively than others, but it feels so easy to waste time watching Youtube videos and surfing reddit in my home office compared to a coffee shop or my department office. Humans are incredibly spatially aware, and maintaining strong associations between activities and spaces has always been really helpful for me whenever I’ve noticed I’m having trouble spending time the way that I want to.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spontaneous interactions. Nothing interesting happens at home - only exactly that which I expect to happen. At the department, I might attend a talk, have a hallway conversation with a professor. I might visit a bookstore on the way home. I might see a gallery opening poster on the walk to the subway. I engage with the world more wholly outside, than inside. This seems trivially obvious, but for a long time I somehow justified paying New York rent to… live inside a small box and (rarely) go outside???&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah I guess if you feel like your life is oddly stagnant and you are frequently wracked with anxiety about whether you are being as productive as you could be, having a hard time justifying relaxation, and feel disconnected from your work… go touch grass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Curiously, even if I don’t accomplish much in the way of work I notice that I’m much more relaxed and less ashamed of slacking off/recharge activities at home if I spend the day out. Something about the primitive brain - daytime outside, nighttime inside. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t alone - a quick perusal of some of the more popular Goodreads reviews reveals some choice frustrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Odell has some interesting points but good lord does it seem like she would be exhausting to talk to at a party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Woman discovers trees and then shares the experience in a language that the rest of us use to write grant proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Collective self-help for middle-class leftist intelligentsia. Has the feeling of taking a leisurely stroll with your loony hippie friend who is at once an overeducated ecosocialist and a crackpot Zen mind-hacker. You have no idea why she loves birdwatching so much (to her it’s a proto-spiritual experience, to you it seems superficially like playing Pokémon Go) nor can you figure out how she affords to live on the Oakland-Piedmont border without a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s strange, because at the core the message of the book is something I actually resonate with fairly deeply. I feel exhausted by the constant pressure to be doing something else, something that might make me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SzvsMFaek&quot;&gt;fitter, happier, more productive&lt;/a&gt; and it seems easy to point the finger at “the attention economy” and the constant comparison to more-successful others that social media usage can engender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me one of the more frustrating features isn’t so much the obscure writing style or assumed privilege of her audience, but a lack of focus on actually understanding why it’s hard to do nothing now. A vague hand wave toward “capitalism” and “the attention economy” is as far as Odell gets. It’s less a book about how to do nothing but one about the myriad spiritual and moral benefits of doing nothing, and why doing nothing is good from different philosophical perspectives. It’s simultaneously didactic and yet doesn’t teach the reader much that is actually useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the meta point is that if you want it to be useful you’re still in the clutches of trying to “do something” rather than “do nothing,” but it seriously comes off as lecturey at best and holier-than-thou at worst. The enlightened sermonize in the California sun while the damned scurry in the urban sewer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">“How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy” by Jenny Odell was probably one of the most annoying books I read in 2022.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Creative Capital and Compound Interest</title><link href="/2023/01/24/compound-interest-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creative Capital and Compound Interest" /><published>2023-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/2023/01/24/compound-interest-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2023/01/24/compound-interest-2.html">&lt;p&gt;When I got out of college I took a job at Facebook as a software engineer and mostly hated it (except for the part where I made way more money than any 23 year old has a right to).

A nontrivial amount of young people in tech (and possibly other industries!) wish they were doing something more creatively or intellectually fulfilling, whether that is social science research, experimental art, screenwriting, ceramics, whathaveyou. At least I was. But I got tempted by the astronomical signing bonus, starting salary, stock options, and the general allure of making a ton of cash as a young person right out of college, and I suspect many of my disenchanted peers fell prey to similar initial motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.insider.com/53ac754b69bedda3512ad279?width=750&amp;amp;format=jpeg&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptation wasn’t material greed per se, but more security. One corner of the internet I discovered quickly was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/&quot;&gt;financial independence subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, which is full of people who meticulously save and invest money with the goal of eventually having enough to retire early and do whatever they want. A popular argument is that compound interest in the modern US stock market is so powerful and reliable that it is optimal to save as much as you can early, because that money will be worth twice, four times, eight times as much by the time one reaches retirement age. By the same logic, making more early on is also exponentially useful, and thus a decently large portion of the subreddit holds jobs they don’t love (or actively hate), holding out for one day getting to do what they actually want to do once they’ve saved up enough money for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple years checking my 401(k) several times per week and projecting out different savings timelines before I said fuck it, quit, and &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/06/11/itp.html&quot;&gt;went to art school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existential suffering aside, I think it’s important to realize that financial capital is not necessarily the most important type of capital you could be accumulating in your early career years. Creative capital is real too, and it also obeys the same laws of compound interest, even if it’s harder to see it. The more you learn and create, the more you can learn and create, and so on. If your actual end goal is to do something interesting with your time (and actually be good at it), it’s far from obvious that the correct path is to not do it so you can make money to do it later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">When I got out of college I took a job at Facebook as a software engineer and mostly hated it (except for the part where I made way more money than any 23 year old has a right to).

Putting content online used to be hard - the few produced, and the (relative) masses consumed. Web 2.0 removed technical barriers, promising a kind of democratization of content creation. Posting to the internet was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when is web 2.1 due out? I’d argue we’ve already arrived. Ignore the crypto fanatics who are trying to claim “Web 3.0” for the decentralized web, and consider how Internet usage has changed since the 2000s. Craigslist, Facebook and MySpace, the leading lights of Web 2.0 feel like prehistoric dinosaurs. Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok dominate. Is it easy to post to these platforms? Technically speaking, yes. Anyone can post. You don’t need to know arcane computer programming skills in order to push content to the internet. But I think we’re missing something by just focusing on the technical details. People who push content to these platforms invest insane amounts of capital into producing content - and unlike early Web 2.0 projects, content on IG, Twitter, and TikTok is public by default. One competes with a global population of content creators who are probably better than you at it because it’s literally their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barrier to entry on early Facebook was low because you were competing with your friends. Most of the time, your friends were interested in what you had to say because you know, they were your friends. The barrier to entry on Twitter is high, because you are competing with Elon Musks’ latest controversy and the dozens-to-hundreds battle worn Twitter influencers who have already crafted a better incisive joke than you. Most people don’t actually care what you have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, what happens is that the pre-existing power law distribution of social networks is exacerbated. A select few people end up being specialized, professional content creators. A slightly larger population tries, mostly in vain, to break into internet stardom. The vast majority lurk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call this influencer-centric model web 2.1. It’s Web 2.0 under the ruthless influence of the market. It’s sometimes good (influencers and content creators are usually more entertaining and interesting than my friends). It’s sometimes bad (influencers and content creators are usually more entertaining and interesting than my friends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is an effort to combat the negative side. While there’s always some kind of pressure posting publicly to the internet I can at least pretend that it’s not being automatically entered into a cutthroat global attention competition. I don’t need my writing to compete in the global content marketplace, hell, there are probably six different authors on Substack that have already written more eloquently than I have or ever will on internet content economics. Fuck it though, I’ll post because I want to write and I need someplace to organize my thoughts and an easy way to share with my friends, who I hope, will be at least politely interested.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Back in the 2000s “Web 2.0” was all the rage.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News is how citizens make sense of the world outside of immediate, local, sensory experience. As the world becomes more interconnected, the prominence of local issues fades and large scale and systemic issues dominate. Journalism’s role of informing the public and serving as the “fourth estate” of robust democratic decision making becomes increasingly important. However, journalism is far from a perfect, even handed information source - it must inevitably choose, curate, and disseminate only those stories it deems newsworthy. Inherent in the New York Times’ slogan that it contains “all the news that’s fit to print” is the admission that “the map is not the territory.” But what is the map? This project is an interpretation of what it would mean to create an all-encompassing map of news, both to give a perspective on what topics were ultimately covered most as well as what stories were ultimately left untold. Over 1 million US headlines published over the course of 2020 were collected, clustered by topic, and transformed into a terrain map of the information landscape. Heavy news coverage brings mountains into prominence, connected stories are bridged by land, while small narratives and threads lapse into chains of islands. The map reflects the landscape throughout time, shifting the positions of continents and sizes of mountains, allowing the viewer to follow stories as they morph throughout the news lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;technical-summary&quot;&gt;Technical Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mediacloud.org&quot;&gt;MediaCloud&lt;/a&gt; indexes mainstream US media content. The first version of this project uses a 77,100 headline selection from the month of February, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clustering&quot;&gt;Clustering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to cluster the headlines together to extract the topics. There are a number of unsupervised topic modeling approaches which generally use a strategy of trying to find sets of words that often occur within the same document. LDA, is probably the most well-known example. However, I chose to use a newer method, GSDMM, which is specifically designed for short texts (like tweets, or news headlines), although at it’s core it uses a similar technique of looking for common word-occurences. I didn’t do any rigorous evaluation, but a cursory, subjective comparison of the two models seemed to suggest that GSDMM’s cluster outputs made more sense to me and better represented different “news topics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/topics.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above slide shows some examples of headlines for a few GSDMM topic clusters from the dataset. Since the model is unsupervised, the algorithm isn’t able to label any of the topics automatically - it’s up to a human observer to identify a meaningful label for each topic. In these cases, it’s fairly straightforward: the left-most topic cluster contains headlines that all have to do with the Democratic primary elections, the center cluster contains headlines that contain lottery winning number announcements, and the right-most cluster contains news regarding various cruise ships impacted by COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set of examples highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the text-clustering algorithm. Since it’s based purely on words (and does not draw on any latent semantic information, eg on word2vec embeddings or similar), all “COVID-19 cruise ship” news is grouped together, despite there being distinct news coverage of different cruise ships. Some non-cruise ship COVID-19 news also is able to sneak into the COVID-19 cruise ship news cluster, presumably because most stories about cruise ships contain words like “death”, “cases”, “quarantine”, etc. While the clustering technique isn’t perfect, it’s a decent place to start to extract meaningful groups of news headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layout&quot;&gt;Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third step is to lay out the topics in a two dimensional space. I want related topics to be close together, and unrelated topics to be further apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existing project &lt;a href=&quot;https://bl.ocks.org/AlessandraSozzi/raw/ce1ace56e4aed6f2d614ae2243aab5a5/&quot;&gt;LDAVis&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for researchers to quickly interpret the results of topic models, lays out topics in a two dimensional space, grouping similar topics close together. However, I want my news map to be usable for folks without an understanding of token salience, lambda parameters, and so forth. In addition, LDAVis’s layout algorithm (multidimensional scaling) is relatively naive, is computationally expensive with a large number of topics, and doesn’t always place topics that I judge as similar near each other, or places unrelated topics close together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/ldavis.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can utilize the similarity measure of LDAVis - the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The missing component is how to lay out the topics while attempting to preserve distances (inversely) proportional to their similarity scores. For example, consider a topic cluster containing headlines on the Harvey Weinstein trial has a relatively high similarity score to a topic cluster on the 2020 Oscar award ceremony, which has a high similarity score to a third topic cluster about new movie releases on Netflix. Ideally, Weinstein’s cluster would be placed closely to the Oscar awards cluster, since his trial and sexual harassment investigations were often discussed in conjunction with his outsized role in the Oscars. However, his trial has less to do with new movies on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I settled on a force-directed layout scheme, where an attractive force is assigned to topic clusters similar to each other, and a repulsive force is assigned to topic clusters further away. Force layout schemes are common in network visualizations, where many nodes and many edges need to be laid out in 2D space. In my case, topic clusters were the nodes, and each cluster had a (weighted) edge between it representing the similarity score between the two clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/force1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a nontrivial amount of tweaking and pruning of the cluster network was required to get a usable layout. First, I deleted low-similarity edges from the graph. I care less that the distance between unrelated clusters is exactly proportional to their degree of non-similarity: it’s more important that they are simply not near each other. Second, I used min-cut graph techniques to isolate highly connected clusters from each other, and then used a second iteration of force layout to position these clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to think of these second-order clusters as continents, with the topic clusters inside of them as regions or countries. For example, several highly connected topics formed a “continent” of political news. Several other highly connected topics formed a “continent” of coronavirus news. These two continents are also similar, given the politicization of the virus even in February of 2020, and so the continents are placed near each other in the second-level force layout. Meanwhile, a third “continent” of sports news can be placed further away from both the politics and coronavirus content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terraforming&quot;&gt;Terraforming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth step is converting the network layout to geography. So far, each cluster has been modeled as a circle, but perfectly circular countries aren’t so visually engaging. I used a classic map-generation technique: I placed points (shown in blue) randomly over the 2D space, then generated the Voronoi polygon set over those points (borders shown in yellow). Polygons whose origin point lay within a topic cluster’s original circle become land, while the remaining polygons become water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/voronoi.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/voronoi2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;label-generation&quot;&gt;Label Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step is to generate names for each region. Each GSDMM topic comes with a set of words most commonly found for each topic cluster. I use a simple &lt;a href=&quot;tracery.io&quot;&gt;tracery&lt;/a&gt; grammar to combine the prominent words for each cluster with map words such as “peninsula,” “cape,” “mountains,” etc. based on the number of adjacent regions (eg, “island” would only be assigned to regions with no neighbors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-final-map&quot;&gt;The Final Map&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/news_map&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/bigmap.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final map is composed of 160 different regions and is fully zoomable, clickable, and explorable. You can explore it yourself &lt;a href=&quot;/news_map&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, exploring the map reveals both latent connections and under-surfaced news stories. For example, while it may be expected that coronavirus news and political news are related to each other, the map also shows that discussion of the economy, the price of gold and stocks, is highly connected to discussions of coronavirus in the mainstream media, perhaps more so than discussion of its human impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/bigcontinent.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the fact that even small topics are visible as small islands, as opposed to being buried underneath the flood of news, allows them to be explored and surfaced in a new way. The map showed, for example, a set of stories on the state of California’s official apology for Japanese internment; something meaningful that didn’t get picked up so much in the news cycle but still very much worth surfacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/FogOfWar/internment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a ton of stuff from working on this project, from the history of journalism to unsupervised NLP techniques to network force-layout strategies. There are a ton of improvements I hope to make: automatic label generation (this seems quite difficult honestly), automated deploys of current data (the existing prototype is frozen to February 2020) to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since the new MacBooks were released I’ve been tempted to upgrade - especially when crunching data in Python or R (in projects like &lt;a href=&quot;/news_map&quot;&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt;, for instance). Running intensive analysis, ML training models, or data transformation jobs locally tends to lock up my computer for tens of minutes at a time, during which I can’t really even use the machine for other tasks at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new MacBooks are shiny, with impressive CPU benchmarks, but as far as I can tell my actual limiting factor is RAM. The datasets I work with are rarely large enough to really justify investing in actual-big-data infrastructure. They should fit in 16gb of RAM more often than not. The problem is that between terribly inefficient Electron apps like Spotify, Slack, several Firefox tabs, VSCode, Docker, and MacOS itself I rarely have all 16gb of RAM available for use. My machine locks up because it starts using the SSD as swap storage for too-high memory demands once the Python or R process exceeds 3-4GB of memory usage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to upgrade my laptop to 32gb, but a new 32gb MacBook runs upward of $3000. Of course, I’d be getting the upgraded M1 mac chip as well, but as I don’t really do much video editing or heavy CPU work in general I’m not totally sure if it’s a very efficient use of the money. Windows/Linux might provide better value for a development machine, but I also value the Mac’s better creative application support - audio tools like Ableton and Max/MSP run much more reliably, and I don’t want to juggle multiple laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began to consider renting cloud compute from Amazon. Thanks to git and Docker it shouldn’t require much setup to get code running on a remote server, and all I really need is the ability to ssh in with the command line, and edit the remote filesystem with VSCode. An EC2 t3.xlarge instance comes with 4 vCPUs and 16gb RAM, and costs approximately 16 cents per hour of usage. This comes out to about $1400 per year, which means that buying a new MacBook would easily provide more value after only about two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the game changes because Amazon only charges for EC2 when the machine is in the “running” state. If I shut it down and start it up only when needed, the costs should go down dramatically. Realistically, I need the extra resources only occasionally - many tasks can still be done on my local machine, and again Docker and git make the self-collaboration process quite smooth. A conservative estimate of 40h of usage per week brings the estimate down to under $400 per year, which means the new MacBook would take closer to 7 years to break even. In addition, the t3.xlarge instance comes with a blazing fast 5gbps internet connection, which is incredibly useful whenever doing any bulk uploading/downloading work, a benefit that a new laptop can’t provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle I ran into is that Amazon likes to change the public hostname every time the machine is restarted. This means that it’s slightly nontrivial to easily restart the machine and reconnect the necessary tools. However, it’s nothing a little bit of shell scripting can’t handle. The Amazon CLI tools provide everything needed to automate the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_ec2_name() {
  aws ec2 describe-instances --i $EC2_ID --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicDnsName' | grep amazon | tail -n 1 | tr -d '&quot; ,'
}

start-ec2() {
  pending=$(aws ec2 start-instances --i $EC2_ID | grep pending);
  while [ -n &quot;$pending&quot; ]
  do
    sleep 0.5;
    pending=$(aws ec2 start-instances --i $EC2_ID | grep pending);
  done
  name=$(get_ec2_name);
  awk_cmd=&quot;/$EC2_HOST_ALIAS/{ n=NR+1 } NR==n{ \$0=\&quot;    HostName $name\&quot; }1&quot;;
  cp ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.bak;
  awk &quot;$awk_cmd&quot; ~/.ssh/config &amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config;
  ssh $EC2_HOST_ALIAS;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get_ec2_name&lt;/code&gt; function uses the instance identifier &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$EC2_ID&lt;/code&gt; - which doesn’t change - to query for the public DNS name. The aws ec2 command returns an array of DNS names, some of them empty strings. The result is piped through grep to only filter for valid DNS names, tail’d to pick the most recent name, and stripped of extra characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start-ec2&lt;/code&gt; function uses the aws cli to issue a start-up request to the instance-id and conveniently returns a JSON object describing the instance’s status. During the startup process the status is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt;, and once the machine is ready for use the status switches to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;running&lt;/code&gt;. The script simply issues repeated &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start-instance&lt;/code&gt; commands at half-second intervals until the instance is ready for use. Next, the public hostname is fetched and I use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; to write the new hostname into my ssh config file. The SSH config file describes settings for a remote connection, and you can use an aliases/labels to organize different connections! In this case, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; script actually looks for the SSH config entry with the label &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$EC2_HOST_ALIAS&lt;/code&gt; and replaces the line immediately following it with the new hostname.
I also set up the relevant other information in the SSH config, including the username and private key file location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Host &amp;lt;EC2_HOST_ALIAS&amp;gt;
    HostName &amp;lt;HOSTNAME&amp;gt;
    User &amp;lt;User&amp;gt;
    IdentityFile &amp;lt;Filepath to private key&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the ssh file is set up properly, all that’s left is to call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ssh $EC2_HOST_ALIAS&lt;/code&gt; to connect using the settings in the config. Even better, VSCode’s remote file setup can reference connections in the ssh config file, so it’s super easy to refresh/reconnect VSCode even though the hostnames change throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workday now starts with a simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start-ec2&lt;/code&gt; command in the terminal and a handful of mouseclicks in VSCode to get my last session reconnected. At the end of the day I log out/shutdown by issuing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo shutdown -h&lt;/code&gt; command on the connected instance. I can connect from anywhere, enjoy industrial network speed, the commitment is low, the setup is easy, and I pay a reasonable price that correlates directly to how much I need the extra resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="engineering" /><summary type="html">I do more and more data analysis and engineering work these days on my local machine, a 2017 MacBook Pro with 16gb of RAM.

Upon scanning the chalkboard menu my eyes were immediately drawn to the red hearts accompanying speculoos cookies and cream, vanilla sweet cream, and fresh strawberry. These are the staff favorites, according to the cheery employee behind the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, next to green pistachio lay a suspicious red smudge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new assistant manager had recently revoked green pistachio’s “favorite” status amid outcry from the junior staff. She had attempted to erase the heart from the blackboard menu but ultimately left behind a faint hint of its former glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the ice cream had changed - so why would its status as favorite be up for debate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pistachio is one of those polarizing flavors - I don’t like it at all, while some of my friends order it everywhere they go. For a pistachio-hating customer (and even some pistachio-loving ones), a pistachio recommendation is essentially useless. Put another way, removing pistachio from the favorites list probably doesn’t really affect how many people order it, since the pool of “persuadable” pistachio customers is small compared to other flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction here I think is between judging a recommendation on its utilization versus its objectivity. Assuming the ice cream staff are actually able to make a more objective judgement of flavor quality (I certainly would trust them more than anyone else), it makes a lot of sense for pistachio to keep its favorite status. But if you’re concerned about whether it’s useful to more customers, a great but controversial option will always see less support than a mediocre, but more palatable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy that centers utilization echoes the “data driven” and “user centered” ethos in tech these days. But it commits the cardinal sin of measuring the wrong thing - just because more people engage with a recommendation, feature, or product doesn’t actually mean it’s “better” - one needs more clearly defined goals. Ice cream satisfaction isn’t obviously correlated with recommendation utilization to me, and if you exist in the margin (ie, are a pistachio lover) this philosophy will only ever see your niche flavor preference pushed further and further to the edge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I recently stepped into a new ice cream shop down the street.

Was it worth it? Is it a “good” program?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the answer is mostly, “it depends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itp.nyu.edu/&quot;&gt;ITP’s website&lt;/a&gt; says that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts whose mission is to explore the imaginative use of communications technologies — how they might augment, improve, and bring delight and art into people’s lives. Perhaps the best way to describe us is as a Center for the Recently Possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informally, ITP also describes itself as “engineering school for artists, and art school for engineers.” A brief look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/courses/itp-courses&quot;&gt;course list&lt;/a&gt; reveals titles like “New Interfaces for Musical Expression,” “Live Image Processing &amp;amp; Performance,” and “Tangible Interaction and Device Design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description is a good introduction but belies one of ITP’s most unique and defining characteristics: its aggressive opposition to structure. For better or worse this philosophy impacts every aspect of the program and student experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/itp_still.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo still taken from ITP promotional material.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At ITP students experiment with form and content in a whirlwind tour of possibility. Sneakers play music when you dance in them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb6eFGbwPeA&quot;&gt;wooden sculptures contort to mirror your image&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://peiqi.su/art/portfolio-penis-wall.html&quot;&gt;walls of 3D printed dicks rise and fall to track the stock market&lt;/a&gt;. At its best ITP is a chaotic, interdisciplinary melting pot where makers of all backgrounds inspire each other to develop creative, imaginative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see how imposing structure on the chaos could stifle the creativity and exploration that ITP prides itself on, and so the program curriculum notably lacks any hint of specialization or formalization. ITP scoffs at the idea of pre-requisites, subfield tracks, and consistent class offerings. Technology changes fast; if ITP is going to be the Center for the Recently Possible it needs nimbleness and flexibility, not deep investments into specific technologies or subprograms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*6hH-PVNXsKfDYYLZGDiRNg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As much as they would hate to admit it, ITP has a lot in common with a certain kind of Silicon Valley hacker ethos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this educational philosophy seems innovative or forward-thinking at first glance it actually has deep roots in ITP’s historical origins. But interactive and creative technology is incredibly different today than when ITP was founded in 1979. While it’s true one can find contemporary &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; like blockchain and XR among the course offerings, the “Center for the recently possible” has yet to adjust in &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; to the radically different technological landscape. In holding tight to its anti-structuralist ethos, ITP can’t fully acknowledge these shifts in technology nor in ITP’s position relative to the wider ecosystem of creative tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1979, the information age had not yet arrived. The first widely commercial personal computers were still a few years away and the Internet was still a US military research project.
At the time ITP was an experimental film program, where “technology” referred more to the Sony Portapek (the first portable video camera) than to Arduino microcontrollers or machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/C64c_system.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Commodore 64C, released in 1986&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in 2021, fully utilizing technology encompasses more than just the ability to operate technical equipment. The ability to control and direct technical equipment - in a word, programming - has become an essential part of a technical creator’s toolkit&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The ability to move from what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/&quot;&gt;Ribbonfarm&lt;/a&gt; calls “below the API” to “above the API” in the context of artistic/creative practice is one of the most valuable things that ITP graduates leave with right now, both in an economic sense&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a creative one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ITP doesn’t seem to fully recognize this in its program structure, only providing one sort-of-required-but-not-really introductory coding class. This class is taught differently by each instructor and is graded pass/fail. As a result, students enter their second semester with only the barest minimum guarantee of coding ability. Moreover, the second semester (and beyond) is a true wild west, with no kinds of “staple” coding elective classes reliably offered in any given semester.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Burns, the godmother of ITP and the original proponent for the anti-structure educational philosophy of the program is famous for saying “the computer is just a tool.” She believed strongly in the strength of creativity over technical aptitude. She goes on, “It’s like a pen. You have to have a pen, and to know penmanship, but neither will write the book for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://uh8yh30l48rpize52xh0q1o6i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/RedBurns1971A.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I wholeheartedly agree with the general idea that creativity is as important (or even more important) than technical aptitude (If you don’t believe this you should just get a computer science degree!), ITPs specific attitude when it comes to computers is as outdated as Red’s pen metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn how to use an audio recorder or film camera in a week. It takes &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; to become a competent programmer. The complexity of a computer encompasses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness&quot;&gt;literal universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP doesn’t need to adopt an entire computer science curriculum. But its ignorance (or naivete) of the categorical difference between computers and other tools leads to noticeable degradations in the student experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One semester isn’t enough to cover everything you need to become an effective computer user. Every elective class that touches on software sets aside a significant portion of time to basic technical content &lt;em&gt;that gets repeated across every class&lt;/em&gt;. Classes on topics as diverse as programmatic video manipulation, live sound synthesis, networked social interactions, generative poetry, embedded device machine learning duplicate literal hours of command line tutorials, Max/MSP introductions, and so forth. Do you want to take this class that uses X technology? Great, ITP will teach it to you! Did you like it, and want to go further? You’ll waste half the next semester learning the basics again, if a class on a similar topic is even offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the opportunity cost of wasted time experienced by probably half of the students during any given class, the wide variation in technical ability also degrades the creative aspects of the ITP experience. Conceptual critique and discussion suffers when half the projects for any given assignment are incomplete or artificially restricted in scope because of technical ability. Good penmanship is not sufficient, &lt;em&gt;but it is necessary&lt;/em&gt; to write a book. How can students push the frontier of eg. data visualization forward when they don’t have a solid grasp on how to manipulate data programmatically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This institutionally cavalier attitude isn’t exclusive to programming at ITP. It carries over to other fields as well. Since the 80s computer scientists, musicians, artists, writers, journalists, and so forth have gone and pioneered subfields like computer music, generative visual art, media studies, game design, data visualization, interactive fiction, etc. These fields have significantly matured as more and more people have gained access to computational tools, but you wouldn’t know it at ITP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP basically completely ignores the existence and history of these subfields&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, giving them only one semester’s worth at best and treating them as virgin territory still to be explored at worst. It doesn’t matter that music composition and performance has a thousands-of-years history - ITP students learn how to revolutionize music technology with a handful of lectures on the nature of pitch and rhythm. It doesn’t matter that computer music is over fifty years old with a rich set of compositional techniques built on each other over time - ITP can teach Markov chains (utilized in music in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1575226&quot;&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, if not earlier) and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55254393e4b0fb9afcd2374e/1517475724910-PCHT9S7SJV4YRJRPKYAJ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIYVcw2xALxYL-MMjB8EEN4UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcoxKHYl9DXn98ncPxaA3FXXFHcF3JYvVfeDBNJTyW7PQb1YcHbM9zJ7GbhRZXN1KT/LaurieS.jpg?format=2500w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP has no sequences of any kind. ITP doesn’t even reliably have a class touching on any given subfield during any given semester.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to a depressingly large portion of class and even thesis projects which simply retread the same ground over and over again. Students and faculty particularly interested in these subareas move on (reasonably so) to more specialized pastures&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, leaving ITP feeling oddly behind the times. So much for “center for the recently possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the strongest subdepartment (if you could even call it that) at ITP is Physical Computing; is it a coincidence that Tom Igoe, a co-inventor of the Arduino microcontroller, and someone who is intimately familiar with the history of microcontrollers in creative contexts is involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP is a great place to be &lt;em&gt;introduced to creating with technology&lt;/em&gt;. I think ITP is best for those with a somewhat lopsided experience between creating, and tech: traditional artists who have only dabbled in more advanced technology, or techies who have only dabbled in creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had lots of experience with technology coming in, and a moderate amount of experience with independent creating. I was often frustrated in looking to develop computer music and creative data practices at ITP. Instead, my favorite classes were all ones that involved simply making as many things as possible with support and critique provided by my classmates and with little to no institutional or academic content/support. I loved devoting a couple years of full time toward refining my own personal creative process and practice. I left ITP feeling fully empowered to pursue creative projects both professionally and personally, something that I certainly didn’t have before enrolling&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP doesn’t need to completely pivot to teaching the state-of-the-art in computer science, music, data science, etc. with rigid prerequisites and classes all at once. The creative spirit at ITP &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; valuable, but I don’t think adding a little more structure would definitively kill it. There’s a lot of room for ITP to explore where exactly on the spectrum of structure it can sit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commit to a handful “staple” courses that students can reliably expect to be taught year over year. ITP already does this with Introduction to Fabrication, which is a class usually offered every semester. Everyone loves it, and I believe its existence explains the overall high quality of sculpture and installation projects at ITP. This should be extended to other areas as well, like computer science, web development, music, generative graphics, game design, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer skills based single credit or 2-credit courses during January or summer term to get rid of the horrendous duplication among electives. This could handle introductions to software/coding areas like Max/MSP, command line, Touchdesigner, Unity, Python, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allow faculty to suggest pre-requisites, or to devise their own one to two course sequences. How much more amazing would the New Instruments class be if it was suggested that students take Code of Music beforehand?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One could argue that programming is not strictly needed to “create with technology”; tools like the Adobe creative suite, CAD programs, Ableton Live and so forth certainly enable a great deal of creative possibility for their users. But I don’t think this argument can be taken seriously in good faith. Programming (or at least programmatic thinking) is a critical skill for any creative technology program in 2021. ITP students should be making Ableton in addition to using it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This matters, when the price tag of your so-called innovative, unconventional master’s program is of a typically regressive magnitude - try $100k on for size. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I attended (from 2019-2021) a web development class only ran one single time, and it wasn’t even a full 4 credit course. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize that my complaints operate on the structural/institutional level. ITP has some fantastic faculty members engaging with their relevant academic/creative subfields. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There’s something to be said for preferring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-do-people-feel-like-their-academic&quot;&gt;develop new fields rather than develop within them&lt;/a&gt;, but I still feel like you need to acknowledge the existence of the current state of the art before you can create something new. Otherwise you’re just going to make something someone already made at Bell labs in the 70s. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Frank Lantz, the creator of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html&quot;&gt;Universal Paperclips&lt;/a&gt; game was originally an ITP faculty member. He wanted to introduce a game design sequence to the curriculum and got stonewalled out, leading to the creation of the NYU Game Center. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It seems scary, but I often wonder what it would have been like to quit my job and simply give myself permission to spend time creating, while seeking out community in other ways. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
