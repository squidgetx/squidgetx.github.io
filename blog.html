        <li>Image integration into post authoring: what's the best way? Some kind of bbcode or md processing? Or raw html?</li>
        <li>CAS authentication and restrictions on editing based on the current user</li>
        <li>Make it look pretty</li>
        <li>IRC chan? haha</li>

      <p>I ordered some electronics parts a few days ago and they finally came in yesterday. They included two Jolly Ranchers in my order. It was a small gesture, but I thought it was sweet of them. No one does that kind of thing anymore.</p>

      <p>05-29 - Review: The Pantry (breakfast) 7/10</p>
      <p>I love eggs, and I love lox. So it goes that I would probably love lox with eggs, a la the popular diner dish often named as the lox scrambler. Unfortunately, this is not the case and I really need to stop ordering this dish. Still, The Pantry's rendition was fairly yummy and as many users on Yelp note, their home fries are delicious. Browned and not too oily, with (maybe a little bit too much) salt, yum. Up past Modern a Pizza, this place is pretty far so not that easy to get to. Price wise it is fair, especially if you go for the pancakes or waffles. They tricked me into ordering toast on the side though, which ended up costing extra.</p>
      <p>Lox Scrambler (with home fries), rye toast, and a nice glass of OJ: $15 incl. tip</p>
      <p>Food: 7/10</p>
      <p>Service: 6/10</p>
      <p>Price: 7/10</p>
      <p>Atmosphere: 8/10</p>

      <p>And relational databases are a go! Thanks ruby, for doing all my hard work for me. Both climbers and posts are fully edit/create/view/index-able and moreover, posts are linked to an individual climber (as an author). </p>
      <p>Next up: paperclip integration for climber profile pics and blog post pics. Idea; implement tags and an image gallery function for each climber? Climber has_many photos, Photo belongs_to climber??</p>
      <p>Mouse over my face.</p>

      <p>Building the climbing team website, which is basically going to be a blogging platform from scratch anyway. This'll be my first real project using Ruby on Rails. So far I've got the basic database set up for the climbers, which is nice and I'm starting to go through the documentation for paperclip, an activerecord extension for handling images and such which will be quite important for profile picture type things as well as image insertions on the blog. Let's hope Ruby's convention over configuration doesn't drive me insane...</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/mediumeight/737a">New track</a>, playing with some mixylodian scales and generally throwing (certain aspects) of conventional harmony out the window. Main progression goes I-bVII-IV and the complementary progression goes ii-IV-v. I suppose it's still a four chord song... haha.</p>

      <p>I've decided to use this site as a makeshift blog of sorts, though I'm too lazy to get a real blogging platform so I'll just be editing posts by hand using list tags, hah!</p></li>
