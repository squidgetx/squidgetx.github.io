<p>Hi! I'm an artist, software engineer, and data scientist based in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

<p>My interests include <a href="/tag/tech+politics">impacts of technology on political communication</a>, <a href='https://soundcloud.com/mediumeight'>experimental music</a>, <a href="/tag/audio">creative audio</a>, <a href='/tag/audiovis'>audio visualization</a>, and general mischief. This website is both a <a href='/portfolio'>collection of projects</a> as well as a <a href='/writings'>blog for my research and (sometimes interactive) essays</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently a graduate student at <a href="/itp-blog">NYU Tischâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program.</a></p>

<p><a href="/tag/climbing">I also enjoy rock climbing</a> and recently <a href="/tag/vanlife">lived full time in a DIY van for about a year</a>.</p>

<p>My graphing calculator clone of Cuberunner has tens of thousands of downloads and is still ranked in the top 10 of all time on ticalc.org. You can see my calculator author profile <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/104/10456.html">here</a>.</p>

<p class='post-meta'>Website powered by Jekyll, themed by Minima with heavy modification.</p>
