<p><a href="/docs/resume.pdf">CV</a></p>

<p>I am an artist, software engineer, and data scientist based in Brooklyn, NY interested in the <a href="/tag/tech+politics">externalities of the attention economy</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mediumeight">experimental music</a>, <a href="/tag/audio">new musical interfaces, and sound installations</a>. I am currently a graduate student at NYU Tischâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program. You can read more about my work there <a href="/tag/itp">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/tag/climbing">I also enjoy rock climbing</a> and recently <a href="/tag/vanlife">lived full time in a DIY van for about a year</a>.</p>

<p>Somehow my graphing calculator clone of Cuberunner has tens of thousands of downloads and is still ranked in the top 10 of all time on ticalc.org. You can see my calculator author profile <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/104/10456.html">here</a>.</p>
