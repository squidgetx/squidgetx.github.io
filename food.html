    <p>Pizza</p>
    <p><a href='http://www.osteriaprocaccini.com/'>Osteria Procaccini</a> in Kingston NJ, the most delicious pizza ever. Close second is <a href='http://www.nomadpizzaco.com/'>Nomad</a>, in Hopewell. Honorable mentions include Modern a Pizza in New Haven</p>

    <p>Burgers</p>
    <p>It's quite interesting how a new kind of burger joint has sprung up in the past two years. Five Guys, Shake Shack, In-n-out... They're all solid restaurants. But the best burger place I have ever been to is <a href='http://www.umami.com/umami-burger/'>Umami Burger</a> in Los Angeles. It's a little on the pricey side and a lot pretentious (think tiny, artfully arranged plates with a lot of negative space), but oh my so delicious. The restuarant grinds their own meat from choice cuts of steak and the shiitake mushrooms are yummy to say the least.</p>

    <p>Ice Cream</p>
    <p>For a long time the <a href='http://www.thebentspoon.net/BENTSPOON/home.html'>Bent Spoon</a> in Princeton NJ took the crown for hands-down, richest, most delicious, locally sourced and bursting with flavor ice cream place. But on a recent visit to Montreal, I think <a href='http://kemcoba.com/'>Kem Coba</a> could really give them a run for their money. The intensity of flavor is really impossible to describe; you'll have to go and see for yourself.</p>
