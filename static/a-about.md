<p>Hi! I'm a researcher, software engineer, artist, and composer based in Brooklyn, NY. Currently I'm studying as a PhD student at NYU Politics. Previously I studied at <a href="/itp-blog">NYU Tischâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program.</a></p>

<p>My main research interests include <a href="/tag/tech+politics">impacts of technological systems on political participation and public opinion</a>.</p>

<p>I also spend time creating <a href='https://soundcloud.com/mediumeight'>music</a>, <a href="/tag/audio">generative/interactive audio</a>, and <a href='/tag/audiovis'>sound visualization</a>.</p>

<p>
This website holds my <a href='/'>portfolio of creative work</a> as well as a <a href='/blog'>blog for smaller projects, research, and essays</a>.
I also write occasionally about <a href="/tag/climbing">rock climbing</a>.
</p>

<p>My graphing calculator clone of Cuberunner has tens of thousands of downloads and is still ranked in the top 10 of all time on ticalc.org. You can see my calculator author profile <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/104/10456.html">here</a>.</p>
