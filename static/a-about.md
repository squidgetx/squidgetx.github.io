<p>Hi! I'm an artist, composer, researcher, and software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY. Currently I'm studying as a graduate student at NYU Politcs. Previously I studied at <a href="/itp-blog">NYU Tischâ€™s Interactive Telecommunications Program.</a></p>

<p>My main interests include <a href="/tag/tech+politics">impacts of technology on political communication</a>, <a href='https://soundcloud.com/mediumeight'>music production/composition</a>, <a href="/tag/audio">generative/interactive audio</a>, and <a href='/tag/audiovis'>sound visualization</a>.</p>

<p>
This website holds my <a href='/'>portfolio of creative work</a> as well as a <a href='/blog'>blog for smaller projects, research, and essays</a>.
I also write occasionally about <a href="/tag/climbing">rock climbing</a>.
</p>

<p>My graphing calculator clone of Cuberunner has tens of thousands of downloads and is still ranked in the top 10 of all time on ticalc.org. You can see my calculator author profile <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/104/10456.html">here</a>.</p>
