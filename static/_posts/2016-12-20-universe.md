description: "an audiovisual musicl system inspired by Newton's laws"
---

This piece is an audiovisual effort inspired by Laurie Spiegel's <i>The Expanding Universe</i> to both visualize and sonify the complex and often chaotic movements that arise from the effects of gravity. The motion of planets as they orbit stars and other large masses is often periodic, dependably repeatable, a good base upon which to build a piece of music. But orbits shift, slowly, imperceptibly sometimes, they collapse and destabilize, only sometimes returning to periodicity.

This project also uses the xbox kinect as an interface through which to intuitively add planets or stars to the system.
