The performer and her [doppelganger](https://nuum.co/project/doppelganger) stand still for a moment. She turns her head to the left. Her doppelganger follows suit. The doppelganger is the performer, but five seconds in the past.

It's cold today. Wind howls through the street. The farmer's market is closed.

A tech company starts sending more irrelevant notifications from its app to a random subset of its users. After a couple weeks, those users spend more time using the app compared to the others. The tech company rolls out the change to all of its users. A year later, I uninstall the app because the notifications are too annoying.

The farmer's market is closed today because twenty years ago there were too many chloroflourocarbons in the atmosphere.

The doppelganger is the performer, but five minutes in the past. The performer turns her head to the right. The doppelganger is sitting in a chair, tying her shoes. Five minutes later, the doppelganger turns her head to the right. But I've already forgotten.
