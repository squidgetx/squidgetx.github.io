_warning: us centric_

Why care about studying media, news and politics?

One thing that I find absolutely fascinating is the stark difference between how important this question is if you talk to (a) any member of the general US public and (b) any political scientist.

Political scientists wouldn't necessarily say that it doesn't matter _at all,_ but simply that the evidence for media effects is rather mixed, and that the vast majority of political scientists are busy studying other interesting political phenomena in the world, like whether having a parliamentary system tends to lead to better behaved politicians or whether local governance of oil pipelines leads to better economic development compared to governance by megacorporations.

On the other hand, journalists and thought influencers on both sides of the US spectrum are constantly yammering about partisan polarization, the perversity of Fox News/MSNBC, the failing New York Times, etc. etc. There seems to be a popular consensus that media effects are in fact, very strong, and that we are fully brainwashed by Laura Ingraham/Tucker Carlsen/Maggie Haberman/Elon Musk.[^1]

Principally, one of the key weaknesses of the media effects academic literature is a rather limited set of interesting outcomes and a relatively underdeveloped theory of how media should, or could affect politics. The most common question asked of media effects is generally whether media affects vote choice. Sometimes a paper will use a _proxy measure_, for instance instead of looking at vote choice you might just ask whether media affects incumbent/candidate approval ratings. Other papers might focus on understanding the _mechanisisms_, delving into the questions of _how_ media affects vote choice or participation (for instance, the classic _priming vs learning_ debate concerns whether media changes voters' candidate evaluations by actually communicating new information or by simply changing the salience of different issues, and priming them to think of those issues more than others when evaluating candidates). The only other outcome that seems to get much attention at all is affective polarization (how much media makes people hate people from the other party).

Critically, most studies done have found very minimal effects of media on both vote choice and polarization.

[^1]: Alternative hypothesis: the academics are right, media effects are minimal, but it's the newspaper's incentive to _convince us_ that they are not minimal so that they can continue to justify their existence.
