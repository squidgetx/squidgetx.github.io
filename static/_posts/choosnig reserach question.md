One of the hardest things to do in research is coming up with a question to work on. A good research question is interesting to you, interesting to others (eg, journal editors), novel, and tractable, all at once.

Pursuing something interesting to you, something that's actually deeply reflective of your experience and values, is art. Making sure it's something that's interesting to others, is [swallowing frogs](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/excuse-me-but-why-are-you-eating): painful for the soul, but occasionally necessary, given that we "live in a society." Doing a good job (because the question is tractable), and doing it for the first time (because the question is novel) are more or less table stakes for anyone who wants to "contribute meaningfully" to the world.

It's hard enough to balance interesting (to editors), tractable with novel (since, if the research question is easy and motivated, someone would have answered it already). But I think it's critically important to not only balance these factors with each other, but also with one's own personal interest (ie, minimize frog eating where possible).

Interesting tends to conflict directly to all three of these other factors. However, I think it's absolutely essential to avoid further transforming the sciences (social science in particular) into useless, overly abstracted, ivory tower paper pushing. What academics find important (and especially, what is novel in a field) is almost guaranteed to be niche, abstract, and barely comprehensible to the median voter. We often trade tractability for interestingness, creating even further layers of separation from something understandable at a low level.

Why "interesting," and not merely "useful," or "applicable?" This short piece could probably still work substituting one for the other. Why not call simply for more "applied" research vs. more "abstract"?
